## Thoughts on antipasta Development

### The Joy of Small Scope

Working on antipasta has been refreshing in its focused simplicity. This isn't trying to be the next ESLint or RuboCop - it's a targeted tool for enforcing code complexity metrics, and that constraint is liberating. The small scope allows for clear decisions and rapid progress.

### From Monolith to Modular

The existing `main.py` is actually quite sophisticated - it already handles multiple metrics (cyclomatic complexity, Halstead, maintainability index) and supports both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript through clever heuristics. The challenge isn't adding functionality but reorganizing what exists into a cleaner architecture.

The planned modular structure feels right:
- Clear separation between metric calculation and presentation
- Plugin architecture for language runners
- CLI as the primary interface

### Decision-Making Process

The planning phase revealed interesting tensions:
- JSON vs YAML configuration (YAML won for expressiveness)
- Hook-first vs CLI-first (CLI won for testability)  
- All languages vs Python-first (Python won for pragmatism)

Each decision simplified the project. By deferring TypeScript support and hook integration, we can focus on getting the core metrics engine right.

### Technical Insights

1. **Complexipy vs Radon**: Having two Python analyzers might seem redundant, but they measure different things. Radon's cyclomatic complexity counts paths; Complexipy's cognitive complexity measures human understanding difficulty.

2. **The Power of Standards**: Using modern Python tooling (pyproject.toml, ruff, black, mypy) from the start prevents technical debt. These aren't just nice-to-haves for a small project - they're the foundation for maintainable code.

3. **Steel Thread Philosophy**: Building the minimum viable path first (Python → CLI → single metric) before adding breadth is proving wise. It's tempting to build all the runners at once, but that path leads to half-finished features.

### Emotional Notes

There's something satisfying about working on developer tools. Every improvement to antipasta potentially improves other codebases. It's meta-programming in the best sense - code that helps write better code.

The project name change from "ccguard" to "antipasta" was more than cosmetic. "Guard" felt passive; "cop" implies active enforcement. It's a small thing, but names matter for developer tools. They should be memorable and convey purpose.

### Looking Forward

The real test will be the implementation. The planning is solid, the architecture is clean, but code has a way of revealing hidden complexities. Still, with the focused scope and clear priorities, this feels achievable.

The fact that this is "mainly for personal use" is freeing. No need to handle every edge case or support every workflow. Just build something useful that enforces good practices. If others find it helpful, that's a bonus.

### Final Thought

Small, focused tools are undervalued in our industry. Not everything needs to be a platform or framework. Sometimes you just need a cop on the beat, keeping the code quality honest. That's antipasta, and that's enough.
