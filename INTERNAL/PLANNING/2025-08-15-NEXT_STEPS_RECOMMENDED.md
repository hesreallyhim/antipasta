üöÄ Immediate Priorities

  1. Add Language Support (High Impact)

  Currently only Python is supported. Adding JavaScript/TypeScript would
  greatly expand usability:
  - Implement JavaScriptRunner and TypeScriptRunner classes
  - Integrate ESLint's complexity rules or similar tools
  - This would cover most modern web development stacks

  2. Package and Publish (Essential)

  Make it installable via pip:
  - Create proper pyproject.toml with all metadata
  - Publish to PyPI as antipasta
  - Add installation instructions: pip install antipasta
  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated releases

  3. Fix Function-Level Metrics

  The current implementation doesn't properly track function-level LOC:
  - Investigate if Radon can provide this data differently
  - Consider alternative analyzers that provide function-level LOC
  - Or clearly document this limitation

  üìä Enhancements

  4. Add Trending/History

  Track metrics over time:
  - Store historical data in SQLite or JSON
  - Add antipasta trends command to show changes
  - Generate charts showing complexity trends
  - Useful for tracking technical debt

  5. IDE/Editor Integrations

  - VS Code extension
  - Pre-commit hook package
  - GitHub Action
  - GitLab CI template

  6. Improve TUI Dashboard

  The terminal UI could be enhanced:
  - Add real-time file watching
  - Show git diff integration (complexity of changes)
  - Add search/filter capabilities
  - Export reports from TUI

  üéØ Advanced Features

  7. Smart Suggestions

  - Suggest refactoring when complexity exceeds thresholds
  - Identify duplicate code patterns
  - Recommend function splits based on complexity

  8. Team Features

  - Complexity budgets per team/module
  - Ownership mapping (CODEOWNERS integration)
  - Slack/Teams notifications for violations

  9. Performance Optimizations

  - Parallel file analysis
  - Incremental analysis (only changed files)
  - Caching layer for large codebases

  üìù Documentation & Quality

  10. Testing & CI

  - Increase test coverage (currently seems minimal)
  - Add integration tests
  - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Add badges to README

  11. Better Examples

  - Create a examples/ directory with sample projects
  - Video tutorial/demo
  - Comparison with similar tools (flake8, pylint, etc.)

  üîß Technical Debt

  12. Refactoring Needs

  - Some files are quite large (stats.py is 600+ lines)
  - Consider splitting into smaller, focused modules
  - Add type hints throughout
  - Improve error messages and handling

  My Top 3 Recommendations to Start:

  1. Package and publish to PyPI - This makes adoption much easier
  2. Add JavaScript/TypeScript support - Doubles your potential user base
  3. Create GitHub Action - Easy integration for CI/CD pipelines

  Would you like me to help implement any of these next steps?
