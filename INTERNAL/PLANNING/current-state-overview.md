# antipasta Project State Overview

## Executive Summary

antipasta has evolved from a simple Claude Code hook into a comprehensive code quality enforcement tool with a modular Python package architecture. The project has successfully implemented its core functionality (Phase 1 & 2) and made significant progress on the terminal dashboard feature (Phases 1-3), with some components still in development.

## Project Vision vs Current State

### Original Goals (from TICKET_LIST.md)
- **CLI-first design** with commands like `antipasta metrics`, `antipasta validate-config` ✅
- **YAML configuration** with language-specific settings ✅
- **Multi-language support** (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) ⚠️ (Python only)
- **Multiple metric types** (cyclomatic, cognitive, maintainability, etc.) ✅
- **Extensible plugin architecture** ✅
- **Git hook and pre-commit integration** ❌ (deferred)

### Current Implementation
The project has successfully transformed from a monolithic `main.py` script into a well-structured Python package following the planned architecture in `directory-structure.md`.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Core Infrastructure (Phase 1 & 2) ✅

#### Configuration System (T-01) ✅
- Migrated from JSON to YAML configuration
- Implemented Pydantic V2 models for type-safe validation
- Created `validate-config` CLI command
- Generated JSON schema for IDE support
- Example configuration at `.antipasta.yaml`

#### Language Detection (T-02) ✅
- Built extension-based language detector
- Integrated pathspec library for .gitignore support
- Support for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript (detection only)
- File grouping and filtering utilities

#### Python Metrics (T-03, T-04) ✅
- **Radon integration**: Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, Halstead metrics
- **Complexipy integration**: Cognitive complexity analysis
- Subprocess-based execution with robust error handling
- Support for multiple runners per language

#### Aggregation Engine (T-06) ✅
- Violation detection with all comparison operators
- File-by-file and summary reporting
- Configurable thresholds per metric type
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration (0=pass, 2=violations)

### 2. CLI Interface ✅

Successfully implemented all planned CLI commands:
- `antipasta metrics [FILES/DIRS]` - Analyze code metrics
- `antipasta validate-config [CONFIG]` - Validate YAML configuration
- `antipasta stats [PATH]` - Statistical analysis (bonus feature!)
- `antipasta tui` - Terminal dashboard

The `stats` command was an unplanned addition that provides:
- Average LOC per file/directory/module
- Metric statistics with grouping options
- CSV/JSON export capabilities

### 3. Terminal Dashboard (TERM-001 through TERM-012) ✅

#### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- Textual framework integration
- Base dashboard application with layout
- CLI entry point (`antipasta tui`)
- Data bridge to core engine

#### Phase 2: Core Widgets ✅
- Interactive file tree with complexity indicators
- Metrics overview panel with statistics
- Heatmap visualization using Unicode blocks
- Detail view with function-level breakdown

#### Phase 3: Interactive Features ✅
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts (Vim-style navigation)
- Focus management with visual indicators
- Command palette with 40+ commands
- Advanced filtering system with presets

### 4. Documentation & Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests (74% coverage, 65+ tests)
- Multiple demo files showcasing different complexity patterns
- Tutorial series on complexity reduction techniques
- Analysis of automated refactoring patterns

## Current Architecture

```

## What's Not Implemented

### 1. Multi-Language Support (T-05)
- JavaScript/TypeScript runners not implemented
- Language detection exists but no actual analysis for JS/TS
- `ts-complex` npm package integration deferred

### 2. Hook Integration (T-07)
- Pre-commit framework support not implemented
- Git hooks not created
- Original `main.py` not yet migrated to `hooks/claude.py`

### 3. Terminal Dashboard Advanced Features
- **Phase 4**: Visualizations (trends, comparisons, minimap)
- **Phase 5**: Watch mode, export, themes, plugins
- **Phase 6**: Performance optimization, accessibility

### 4. Web Dashboard (DASH-001 through DASH-020)
- Entire web dashboard system not started
- Would provide React-based visualizations
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Historical tracking and trends

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Python-First**: Focused on Python analysis, deferring other languages
2. **Textual for TUI**: Chosen for its React-like component model
3. **Multiple Runners**: Changed from one-runner-per-language to support multiple
4. **Complexipy Handling**: Special file-based output handling required
5. **Exit Codes**: 0 for success, 2 for violations (not 1)

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **CSS Variable Bug**: Removed unused `$panel` variable that caused Textual crashes
2. **Terminal State**: Mouse tracking can be left enabled on crashes
3. **Large Codebases**: May need optimization for 10k+ file projects
4. **Watch Mode**: Not yet implemented in terminal dashboard
5. **Theme System**: Placeholder only, not connected to UI

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Terminal Dashboard Phase 4** - Add trend visualizations and comparisons
2. **Implement Watch Mode** - Critical for developer workflow
3. **Package for PyPI** - Make tool publicly available
4. **Migrate main.py** - Move to hooks/claude.py as planned

### Medium Term
1. **JavaScript/TypeScript Support** - Complete multi-language vision
2. **Performance Optimization** - Handle very large codebases
3. **Pre-commit Integration** - Enable git workflow integration
4. **Theme System** - Complete terminal customization

### Long Term
1. **Web Dashboard** - Provide rich visualizations
2. **Plugin Architecture** - Enable community extensions
3. **Historical Database** - Track metrics over time
4. **IDE Integrations** - VSCode, PyCharm extensions

## Success Metrics

The project has achieved its core goals:
- ✅ Working CLI tool for Python code analysis
- ✅ YAML configuration with validation
- ✅ Multiple metric types including cognitive complexity
- ✅ Rich terminal interface for visualization
- ✅ Extensible architecture for future growth

The foundation is solid and the tool is production-ready for Python projects, with clear paths for expansion to meet the full vision.
