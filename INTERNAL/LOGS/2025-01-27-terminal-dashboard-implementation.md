# Terminal Dashboard Implementation Log

## Date: 2025-01-27

## Summary

Implemented the foundation for the terminal dashboard feature (Phase 1: TERM-001 through TERM-004) as outlined in the planning documents.

## Completed Tasks

### TERM-001: Set up Textual framework
- Added `textual>=0.70.0` to requirements.txt
- Created `antipasta/terminal/` package structure with subdirectories:
  - `widgets/` - For reusable UI components
  - `utils/` - For utility functions
  - `themes/` - For color schemes and styling

### TERM-002: Create base dashboard application
- Implemented `TerminalDashboard` class in `dashboard.py`
- Created base layout with 4 panels:
  - File tree explorer (left panel)
  - Metrics overview (top right)
  - Complexity heatmap (bottom left)
  - Detail view (bottom right)
- Added keyboard bindings:
  - `q` - Quit
  - `r` - Refresh
  - `?` - Help
  - `1-4` - Switch views
  - `j/k` - Vim-style navigation
  - Tab/Shift+Tab - Panel navigation
- Created `dashboard.tcss` for styling with color-coded complexity indicators

### TERM-003: Add CLI entry point
- Created `antipasta/cli/tui.py` with `tui` command
- Added support for:
  - `--path` - Project directory to analyze
  - `--watch` - Live updates (placeholder)
  - `--theme` - Color theme selection (placeholder)
  - `--no-unicode` - ASCII-only mode (placeholder)
- Updated `antipasta/cli/metrics.py` to support `--format=terminal` option
- Also added `--format=json` support for machine-readable output

### TERM-004: Build data bridge to core engine
- Created `DashboardDataBridge` class in `data_bridge.py`
- Implemented key methods:
  - `analyze_all()` - Analyze entire project
  - `analyze_file()` - Analyze single file
  - `get_file_tree()` - Hierarchical file structure with metrics
  - `get_heatmap_data()` - Directory-level complexity aggregation
  - `get_metrics_summary()` - Overall statistics and distribution
- Added caching layer for performance
- Prepared for future file watching capabilities

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Textual Framework**: Chosen for its modern React-like component model and excellent documentation
2. **Data Bridge Pattern**: Separates UI concerns from core engine, enabling easy testing and future web dashboard reuse
3. **Lazy Loading**: File analysis is deferred until needed to improve startup time
4. **Complexity Calculation**: Uses maximum of cyclomatic and cognitive complexity for visual indicators

## Next Steps (Phase 2: Core Widgets)

The foundation is now in place. The next phase involves implementing the interactive widgets:

1. **TERM-005**: File tree widget with expand/collapse and search
2. **TERM-006**: Metrics overview panel with proper charts
3. **TERM-007**: Interactive heatmap visualization
4. **TERM-008**: Detail view with syntax highlighting

## Technical Notes

### Current Limitations
- File watching not yet implemented (placeholder in data bridge)
- Theme selection not connected to UI
- Unicode/ASCII mode not implemented
- No persistent state between sessions

### Performance Considerations
- Currently analyzes all files on startup - may need optimization for large codebases
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for file tree
- May need to add progress indicators for long-running analyses

### Integration Points
- Successfully integrated with existing CLI structure
- Reuses core engine components (MetricAggregator, CodeCopConfig)
- Compatible with existing configuration files

## Testing Recommendations

Before proceeding to Phase 2, consider adding:
1. Unit tests for DashboardDataBridge
2. Integration tests for CLI commands
3. Manual testing with various project sizes
4. Performance benchmarking for large codebases

## Known Issues

1. Diagnostic warnings about missing textual imports (expected until `pip install` is run)
2. TODO items remain for:
   - JSON config support in data bridge
   - File watching implementation
   - Theme/option passing from CLI to dashboard

These can be addressed in future iterations.
