# Terminal Dashboard Widgets Implementation Log

## Date: 2025-01-27

## Summary

Completed Phase 2 of the terminal dashboard implementation (TERM-005 through TERM-008), creating all core interactive widgets as outlined in the planning documents.

## Completed Tasks

### TERM-005: Implement file tree widget
- Created `FileTreeWidget` in `widgets/file_tree.py`
- Features:
  - Expandable/collapsible tree nodes
  - Color-coded complexity indicators (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ ðŸ”´)
  - Violation count badges
  - Keyboard navigation (Enter to select, Space to expand)
  - File selection message emission
  - Prepared for search functionality (placeholder)

### TERM-006: Create metrics overview panel
- Created `MetricsOverviewWidget` in `widgets/metrics_overview.py`
- Features:
  - Summary statistics display (total files, success rate, violations)
  - Complexity distribution with progress bars
  - Color-coded complexity levels
  - Violations breakdown by type
  - Reactive updates when metrics change

### TERM-007: Build heatmap visualization
- Created `HeatmapWidget` in `widgets/heatmap.py`
- Features:
  - Directory-level complexity aggregation
  - Visual heat bars using Unicode blocks (â–‘â–’â–“â–ˆ)
  - Color-coded directory paths based on average complexity
  - Interactive selection with click support
  - Shows file count and violations per directory
  - Directory selection message emission

### TERM-008: Implement detail view panel
- Created `DetailViewWidget` in `widgets/detail_view.py`
- Features:
  - File path and name display
  - Metrics summary formatting
  - Function complexity table (prepared for future function-level data)
  - Violations listing grouped by type
  - Scrollable content area
  - Empty state handling

## Architecture Improvements

### Widget Communication
- Implemented message-based communication between widgets:
  - `FileSelected` message from file tree to detail view
  - `DirectorySelected` message from heatmap
- Dashboard acts as message broker, updating appropriate widgets

### Styling System
- Comprehensive CSS styling in `dashboard.tcss`:
  - Consistent color scheme for complexity levels
  - Responsive layouts with proper sizing
  - Visual feedback for selections
  - Progress bar styling for distributions
  - Proper spacing and padding throughout

### Data Flow
- Widgets receive data through reactive properties
- Update methods allow dynamic content refresh
- Data bridge provides formatted data for each widget type

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **CSS Compatibility**: Discovered that Textual CSS doesn't support `font-size` property, used `text-style` instead
2. **Widget Layout**: Properly structured nested containers for complex layouts
3. **Message Handling**: Implemented proper message routing in dashboard
4. **Data Formatting**: Created appropriate data transformations for each widget type

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Interactive Features (TERM-009 through TERM-012)
1. **TERM-009**: Keyboard shortcut system
2. **TERM-010**: Focus management  
3. **TERM-011**: Command palette
4. **TERM-012**: Filtering system

### Phase 4: Visualizations (TERM-013 through TERM-016)
1. **TERM-013**: ASCII charts
2. **TERM-014**: Trend view
3. **TERM-015**: Comparison mode
4. **TERM-016**: Minimap widget

## Current Functionality

The terminal dashboard now provides:
- Full project analysis on startup
- Interactive file exploration with complexity indicators
- Real-time metrics overview
- Visual heatmap of directory complexities
- Detailed file information on selection
- Keyboard navigation support

## Usage

```bash
# Launch terminal dashboard
antipasta tui

# Launch for specific directory
antipasta tui --path ./src

# Alternative via metrics command
antipasta metrics --format=terminal
```

## Known Limitations

1. Search functionality not yet implemented in file tree
2. No file watching/auto-refresh yet
3. Theme selection not connected
4. No persistent state between sessions
5. Function-level metrics not yet available in detail view

## Performance Notes

- Successfully tested on the antipasta project itself
- Quick startup and responsive navigation
- May need optimization for very large codebases
- Consider virtual scrolling for huge file trees

The terminal dashboard is now functionally complete for basic usage with all core widgets implemented and working together.
