# Implementation Log: Phase 1 - code-cop

## 2025-01-25

### Starting Phase 1 Implementation

**Context**: Beginning the refactoring of `main.py` into a modular Python package structure for code-cop.

**Plan**: Following the implementation handoff document, starting with:
1. Create `pyproject.toml` with hatchling build backend
2. Set up development tools (ruff, black, mypy)
3. Create package structure
4. Set up GitHub Actions

**Key Decisions**:
- Using Python 3.11 (as specified in `.python-version`)
- Hatchling as build backend (modern, lightweight)
- CLI framework: Will evaluate Click vs argparse during implementation
- Following strict package structure from `PLANNING/directory-structure.md`

### Creating pyproject.toml

Starting with a comprehensive `pyproject.toml` that includes:
- Project metadata
- Dependencies (both runtime and dev)
- Tool configurations for ruff, black, mypy
- Entry point for CLI command

This will serve as the foundation for the entire project.

### Development Tools Setup

Created additional configuration files:
- `.editorconfig` - Ensures consistent code formatting across different editors
- `Makefile` - Provides convenient commands for development tasks (format, lint, test, etc.)

The main tool configurations (ruff, black, mypy, pytest) are already in `pyproject.toml`.
